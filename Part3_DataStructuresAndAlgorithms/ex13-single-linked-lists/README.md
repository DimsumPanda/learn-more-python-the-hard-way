## Prerequisites
If you haven't already, install venv and the requirements (e.g. pytest).

. ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can either run `pytest` which will run run all files of the form test_*.py or *_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, it follows standard [https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#test-discovery](test discovery rules).
